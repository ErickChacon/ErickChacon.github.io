{{site.title}} is my homepage and blog. I am a PhD student in Statistics and Epidemiology in the Faculty of Health and Medicine at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) supervised by [Dr. Benjamin Taylor](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/taylorb1/) and [Dr. Luke Parry](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/people/luke-parry). I work in the research group called [CHICAS](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/) (Centre for Health, Informatics, Computing and Statistics). Previously, I obtained my Master of Science degree in Statistics at Lancaster University and my Bachelor and Engineering degree at [Universidad Nacional de Ingenier√≠a](http://www.uni.edu.pe/).
