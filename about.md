Currently, I am a PhD student in Statistics and Epidemiology in the Faculty of Health and Medicine at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) supervised by [Dr. Benjamin Taylor](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/taylorb1/). In particular, I work in the research group called [CHICAS](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/) (Centre for Health, Informatics, Computing and Statistics). Previously, I obtained my Master of Science degree in Statistics with Distinction at Lancaster University and my Bachelor and Engineering degree at [Universidad Nacional de Ingenier√≠a](http://www.uni.edu.pe/).

My research interest relies on a mix of:

- Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Modelling
- Bayesian Statistics
- Computational Intensive Methods
- Big Data
- Data Visualization
- Complex Systems Modelling

With application on:

- Epidemiology
- Climate Change
- Extreme Events
- Others Complex Systems
