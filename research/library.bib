abstract = {Two new implementations of the EM algorithm are proposed for maximum likelihood fitting of generalized linear mixed models. Both methods use random (independent and identically distributed) sampling to construct Monte Carlo approximations at the E-step. One approach involves generating random samples from the exact conditional distribution of the random effects (given the data) by rejection sampling, using the marginal distribution as a candidate. The second method uses a multivariate t importance sampling approximation. In many applications the two methods are complementary. Rejection sampling is more efficient when sample sizes are small, whereas importance sampling is better with larger sample sizes. Monte Carlo approximation using random samples allows the Monte Carlo error at each iteration to be assessed by using standard central limit theory combined with Taylor series methods. Specifically, we construct a sandwich variance estimate for the maximizer at each approximate E-step. This suggests a rule for automatically increasing the Monte Carlo sample size after iterations in which the true EM step is swamped by Monte Carlo error. In contrast, techniques for assessing Monte Carlo error have not been developed for use with alternative implementations of Monte Carlo EM algorithms utilizing Markov chain Monte Carlo E-step approximations. Three different data sets, including the infamous salamander data of McCullagh and Nelder, are used to illustrate the techniques and to compare them with the alternatives. The results show that the methods proposed can be considerably more efficient than those based on Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. However, the methods proposed may break down when the intractable integrals in the likelihood function are of high dimension.},

@article{Holmes2006,
abstract = {In this paper we discuss auxiliary variable approaches to Bayesian binary and multinomial regression. These approaches are ideally suited to au- tomated Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. In the rst part we describe a simple technique using joint updating that improves the performance of the con- ventional probit regression algorithm. In the second part we discuss auxiliary variable methods for inference in Bayesian logistic regression, including covariate set uncertainty. Finally, we show how the logistic method is easily extended to multinomial regression models. All of the algorithms are fully automatic with no user set parameters and no necessary Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject steps.},

@article{Gamerman1997,
abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models provide a unified framework for treatment of exponential family regression models, overdispersed data and longitudinal studies. These problems typically involve the presence of random effects and this paper presents a new methodology for making Bayesian inference about them. The approach is simulation-based and involves the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The usual iterative weighted least squares algorithm is extended to include a sampling step based on the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm thus providing a unified iterative scheme. Non-normal prior distributions for the regression coefficients and for the random effects distribution are considered. Random effect structures with nesting required by longitudinal studies are also considered. Particular interests concern the significance of regression coefficients and assessment of the form of the random effects. Extensions to unknown scale parameters, unknown link functions, survival and frailty models are outlined.},
