As an statistician and software developer enthusiast, I believe that C++ is an excellent tool to boost your code in your preferred language for data analysis like R, python or Julia. Check the following link for more information about multi-software packages develop. Anyway, there are several reason why C++ is so useful, so I will make some posts for an introduction to C++ based on the course called Introduction to C++ on edX.

## Basic Program Structure of C++ Code

In particular, this post is about the program structure of a C++ script.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
